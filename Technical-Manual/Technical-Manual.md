## Assembly 

### Creating Stock
First, you want to start with making a stock that will hold all of the components the WiFi sniper will use. Although not completely necessary to have a functioning system, the coolness factor of having a "gun" that you can hold and point at where you want to scan WiFi networks as well as the looks you get from people more than makes it worth it. 


I recommend basing the design of the stock off a prexisting gun stock and tracing out the outline on the 1x4 of where you want to cut out/shape. (I traced out an airsoft AK47 I happened to have and it ended up working great). Don't forget to also plan out where you want to place all the components.

### Attaching components
Now we move onto mounting components, this part is pretty straight-forward as all we need to do is screw the yagi antenna onto the end of the stock we made and secure it with the washers and screws that came with the antenna. I recommend using velcro tape to hold the Alfa Card and Pi 5 this way they can be detatched at convienence. Also be sure to use the N Type to RP-SMA adapter to connect the ALFA card and Yagi.
