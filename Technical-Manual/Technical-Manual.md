In order to cut out the wooden stock an electric saw is required as well as a polishing sandpaper tool (for a smoother finished product).

### Tupavco TP513 Yagi Wireless Antenna

Although not the best quality Yagi antenna, it gets the job done for long-distance scanning of WiFi networks. The antenna is rated for 2.4GHz at 17dBi and uses a RP-SMA male connector, meaning that an adapter is neaded in order to plug the antenna into the ALFA wireless adapter card. 

## Assembly 

### Creating Stock
First, you want to start with making a stock that will hold all of the components the WiFi sniper will use. Although not completely necessary to have a functioning system, the coolness factor of having a "gun" that you can hold and point at where you want to scan WiFi networks as well as the looks you get from people more than makes it worth it. 


I recommend basing the design of the stock off a prexisting gun stock and tracing out the outline on the 1x4 of where you want to cut out/shape. (I traced out an airsoft AK47 I happened to have and it ended up working great).

Also important not to forget to plan out where you want to place all the components. I ended up attaching a laser sight I also happened to have laying around because why not.

### Attaching components
Now we move onto mounting components, this part is pretty straight-forward as all we need to do is screw the yagi antenna onto the end of the stock we made and secure it with the washers and screws that came with the antenna. I recommend using velcro tape to hold the Alfa Card and Pi 5 this way they can be detatched at convienence. Also be sure to use the N Type to RP-SMA adapter to connect the ALFA card and Yagi. I ended up drilling a small hole into part of the end of the Yagi so that I could attach a ziptie to hold down the coax cable.
