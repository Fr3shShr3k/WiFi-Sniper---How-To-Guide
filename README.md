# WiFi-Sniper---How-To-Guide

The purpose of this guide is to detail a personal project of mine of creating a WiFi Sniper which can be used for long-range wireless network recon. Within this guide are a technical manual which provides detailed instructions on how to create a WiFi sniper similar to mine including a bill of materials, a technical design, as well as the software used to handle logging of scanned devices. These guides should be able to help you create a rudimentary WiFi sniper which you can improve upon:) 



## üîç About WiFi Snipers

A WiFi Sniper is a long-range wireless network reconnaissance toolkit designed for security research, penetration testing, and red team operations. Built with portability and precision in mind, this project leverages directional antennas, high-gain adapters, and automation to detect and analyze WiFi signals from extended distances.

The goal of WiFi Sniper is to overcome traditional range limitations by combining hardware enhancements (e.g., Yagi antennas, parabolic dishes) with software tools that streamline scanning, logging, and signal analysis. This can be useful for locating rogue access points, mapping WiFi coverage in hard-to-reach areas, or testing wireless security in large environments.
